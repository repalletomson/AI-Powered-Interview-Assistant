Requirements for ${difficulty} level:
- Question MUST be about: ${primaryTech || 'JavaScript, React, Node.js'}
- Keep it simple and focused on ONE concept
- Should be practical and commonly used in projects
- Answerable within the time limit (${difficulty === 'easy' ? '20' : difficulty === 'medium' ? '60' : '120'} seconds)
- Ask about HOW they use it in their projects
- Avoid complex system design questions
- Focus on practical implementation

Examples of good questions:
- Easy: "How do you handle state in React components?"
- Medium: "Explain how you would fetch data from an API in React"
- Hard: "How do you optimize React component performance?"
